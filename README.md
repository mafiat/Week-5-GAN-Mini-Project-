# Week-5-GAN-Mini-Project

## Overview
This mini-project demonstrates the implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as part of the Deep Learning course (Module 5, Week 5). The project includes code, experiments, and results for training a GAN on a sample dataset.

## Features
- GAN architecture (Generator & Discriminator)
- Training loop and evaluation
- Sample generation and visualization

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Modify configuration parameters in `config.py` as needed.
- Generated samples will be saved in the `output/` directory.

## Folder Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point for training and evaluation.
- `models/`: Contains GAN model definitions.
- `data/`: Dataset and data loading scripts.
- `output/`: Generated images and logs.
